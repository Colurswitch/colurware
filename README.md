# ColurWare

Say hello to the future of OSes.

Colurware is an operating system that I plan on making real in the future and decided to make a web version so you can see how the real thing will be like.

The web version includes:

- Floating + Rounded taskbar
- Custom widget editor
- Unbl*cker built in to Chrome
- Futuristic file explorer
- Masonry-like start menu
- The ability to group apps on desktop
- Ch*t built-in
- Dynamic background
- Light/Dark mode
- A secret feature!

The web version unfourtanutely does NOT have:

- The ability to group apps on taskbar
- Network settings

## Local Quick Start

- Clone to your local
- Install dependencies `npm install`
- Run locally `npm serve`
- Make requests
  - Browser: `http://localhost:3000/some/path?q=query+one&q=second+query&single=value`
  - Command line: `curl -i -XGET "http://localhost:3000/cmd/line-curl"`

## Deploy in under 10 seconds

[![Deploy to Cyclic](https://deploy.cyclic.app/button.svg)](https://deploy.cyclic.app/)
- Sets up instant continuous deployment on `git push`
- Realtime backend logs and API request monitoring

### Cyclic Runtime

- Cyclic hosts your app on serverless infrastructure. That means there is no guarantee of memory or file system persistence between requests.
- The runtime expects a nodejs entry point defined as:
  - package.json "main" field defines the entry point file (if missing uses index.js)
  - Entry point starts a server on `process.env.PORT`
